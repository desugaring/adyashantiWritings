<t>A Single Desire</t>

<p>Awakeness is inherent</p>
<p>in all things and all beings</p>
<p>everywhere</p>
<p>all the time.</p>
<p>This awakeness relates to every moment</p>
<p>from innocence</p>
<p>from absolute honesty</p>
<p>from a state where you feel</p>
<p>absolutely authentic.</p>
<p>Only from this state</p>
<p>do you realize</p>
<p>that you never really wanted</p>
<p>whatever you thought you wanted.</p>
<p>You realize</p>
<p>that behind all of your desires</p>
<p>was a single desire:</p>
<p>to experience each moment</p>
<p>from your true nature.</p>
